## **General structure of the workshop**

- **March 2 - March 7**: You learn the tool (docs, videos and tutorials).
- **March 8 - March 13**: You will try to use acquired knowledge to verify ERC4626.
- **March 14 - March 15**: Competition.

During the workshop, you can ask questions on Discord (the fastest way to get an answer) or during office hours (OH). Office hour is a meeting, kind of Q&A. However, it can be at the same time with our talks/lectures. In this case, we start with a talk, then we go to questions.

One more important thing about OH. It might be a situation that nobody joins. That's why in order to save time we want to ask you to text/ping us on Discord that you will attend the next OH. Therefore, we know that somebody will join and it makes sense for us to be there. At least 30 mins before OH. I hope, it's understandable.

Also, we will have several talks that will be recorded, so don't worry if you can't make it. During that talks, we either will go over a contract and setup for it (for ERC4626 and Competition) or will explain something about the tool ("Thinking about properties"). The time of these talks will be announced soon.
